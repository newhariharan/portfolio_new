<h3>Shutter Island </h3>

<p>In 1954, up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the 
disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. 
He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he 
thinks he's been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical 
treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd 
investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access 
to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off 
communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals "escape" in the confusion, 
and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - 
his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.—alfiehitchie</p>


<h3>Django Unchained </h3>

<p>In 1858, a bounty-hunter named King Schultz seeks out a slave named Django and buys 
him because he needs him to find some men he is looking for. After finding them, 
Django wants to find his wife, Broomhilda, who along with him were sold separately 
by his former owner for trying to escape. Schultz offers to help him if he chooses 
to stay with him and be his partner. Eventually they learn that she was sold to a 
plantation in Mississippi. Knowing they can't just go in and say they want her, 
they come up with a plan so that the owner will welcome them into his home and 
they can find a way.—rcs0411@yahoo.com</p>

<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street </h3>

<p>In the early 1990s, Jordan Belfort teamed with his partner Donnie Azoff and started 
brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont. Their company quickly grows from a staff of 20 to a 
staff of more than 250 and their status in the trading community and Wall Street grows 
exponentially. So much that companies file their initial public offerings through them. 
As their status grows, so do the amount of substances they abuse, and so do their lies. 
They draw attention like no other, throwing lavish parties for their staff when they 
hit the jackpot on high trades. That ultimately leads to Belfort featured on the cover 
of Forbes Magazine, being called "The Wolf Of Wall Street." With the FBI onto Belfort's 
trading schemes, he devises new ways to cover his tracks and watch his fortune grow. 
Belfort ultimately comes up with a scheme to stash their cash in a European bank. 
But with the FBI watching him like a hawk, how long will Belfort and Azoff be able 
to maintain their elaborate wealth and luxurious lifestyles?</p>
